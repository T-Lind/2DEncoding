# 2DEncoding
#### Encoding scheme to turn 2D coordinates into a singular number. Uses a square spiral.

Written in Python but should be easily translatable to any language. Solves this problem in `O(1)` time, which is the most optimal solution possible.

Could be used to compress data better through the FFT.
